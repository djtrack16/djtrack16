## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**djtrack16/djtrack16** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on deciding if I should self-study pure math or get a part-time degree! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Haskell
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on most things related to functional programming, or libraries related to mathematics, scientific computing or PL theory.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced knowledge in FP theory and pure mathematics in general, not specific to any language.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about philosophy, poetry, olive oil, farming (a few things besides coding :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm not on social much but I hang out in functionalprogramming.slack.com or on twitter @nousandnoose
- âš¡ Fun fact: I took of a few years between jobs to farm and make wine.
- Also, I have apparently 70+ followers. I actually had no clue **ANYONE** followed me on here. Seriously. But ok. Chill.
